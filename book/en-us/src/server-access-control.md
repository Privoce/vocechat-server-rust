At settings, the 1st section is Overview, and that's where you can set up the **Default Sign Up** and **Guest Mode**.

- Default Sign up
  - Who can sign up to this server
    - Everyone
    - Invitation Link Only

- Guest Mode
  - If enabled, visitors will see public channels on this server.
    - Enabled
    - Disabled

Guest mode is usually enabled in iframe embed under your site, so that site visitors can directly see your public channel content.
